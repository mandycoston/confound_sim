The current scripts and notebooks all perform high dimensional experiments.

viz_high_dim.Rmd can take a results_folder path to a folder containing a "results.Rds" file that contains the MSE per simulation. 
This notebook displays the MSE for each method.

viz_calib.Rmd also takes a results_folder path to a folder containing a "results.Rds" file;
but this .Rds file must contain the actual predictions as well as the nu values.
Code for saving such an .Rds is in high_dim_binary_expected.Rmd but has **some issues that are currently being resolved**


# Scripts

In the binary/classification setting,

viz_dimyvarying.Rmd plots the results of experiments that vary n = n_o*k and d = d_o *k^2 for k = 1,2,3,... 
It may be possible to incorporate this into the viz_high_dim_varying_param.Rmd notebook, but this work is paused since the work on taking log d/n -> 0 has been paused.


## Regression
regression_calib.R (respectively .Rmd for debugging) runs experiments with a workable parameter setting and saves the predictions for calibration-style plots


# Result Data Files

## Classification results:

### Wider propensities

### (Deprecated) Tight Propensities


## Regression results


### Wider propensities

### (Deprecated) Tight Propensities
Folder: results/highdim/regression/prop_tight

Calib contains predictions for calibration plots in viz_calib.Rmd
expected contains one-off one
varyparams contain experiments for varying parameters
